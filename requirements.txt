The output of bcrypt.hashpw() depends on the following factors:

1. Input Password:
The password being hashed must be provided as a bytes object. Different passwords will result in entirely different hashes.
2. Salt:
bcrypt.gensalt() generates a random salt for each hash operation. Even if the same password is hashed multiple times, the resulting hashes will differ due to the randomness of the salt.
You can also provide a fixed salt if needed, but this is generally discouraged as it reduces security.
3. Work Factor (Cost Factor):
The bcrypt.gensalt(rounds) function allows you to specify the computational cost (default is 12 rounds). A higher number of rounds increases the time required to generate and verify a hash, enhancing security but requiring more processing power.

bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=14)  # Example with 14 rounds
4. Hashing Algorithm:
bcrypt uses the Blowfish algorithm internally. The algorithm ensures that small changes in the input produce vastly different outputs, making it cryptographically secure.
